CODESOFT Internship Task 02: Python GUI Calculator Project Overview

Welcome to Task 02 of CODESOFT internship! In this project, I've created a simple calculator application using Python's tkinter library. This calculator provides a graphical user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

Features

    Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
    User-friendly graphical interface.
    Clear button to reset the input and result fields.

Prerequisites

Before running the calculator, make sure you have the following installed:

    Python: You can download Python from python.org.
    tkinter: Most Python installations come with tkinter by default. If you encounter any issues, ensure that you have this library installed.
